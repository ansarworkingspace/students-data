This project involves the development of a student data creation website, which offers a range of functionalities for administrators. On this platform, administrators have the capability to add student data seamlessly. The system allows administrators to search for students based on various parameters, apply sorting in both ascending and descending order, and employ filters for efficient data retrieval. Additionally, administrators can conveniently block or unblock students, edit their data as needed, and even delete student records. The website stands out as a comprehensive solution for creating and managing student data, thanks to its user-friendly form and diverse set of features.
